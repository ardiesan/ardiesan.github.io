Hollins' book "Finish What You Start: The Art of Following Through, Taking
Action, Executing & Self-Discipline."

## Self-Discipline is Key

It takes more than simply motivation to write code to be a software developer.
It's about developing reliable routines and habits that enable you to work
productively even in the absence of inspiration. Keeping a consistent approach
makes it easier to provide high-quality code and fulfill project deadlines.

## Break Down Large Tasks

Taking on a sizable software project might be intimidating. Divide the work into
smaller, more doable chunks: create the architecture, create each module
separately, create tests, and conduct code reviews. It is simpler to get going
and keep moving forward with this strategy.

## Embrace discomfort

You'll work on difficult assignments that test your
abilities, such as troubleshooting intricate problems or picking up new
technology. Accepting discomfort as a necessary component of growth enables you
to learn new abilities and get over challenges in your endeavors.

## Set Clear priorities

Setting explicit priorities is important when dealing
with numerous tickets and activities. To guarantee you meet deadlines and make
substantial progress, concentrate on the most important tasks, such as resolving
urgent problems or adding important features.

## Eliminate distractions

Your productivity can be greatly impacted by distractions. Try to reduce them by
utilizing productivity tools, allocating specific hours for coding, or locating
a quiet workspace. This aids in maintaining concentration and producing
excellent work.

## The Power of Commitment

Putting your all into your goals and seeing them through to completion is what
it means to be committed. This translates to software development as continuing
to remain committed to finishing projects on time, developing your abilities
over time, and following best practices. When you dedicate yourself to a task,
you are more likely to see it through obstacles and disappointments. Your career
will advance and succeed consistently if you maintain this unrelenting focus and
establish a reputation for dependability and excellence in your work.

## Celebrate achievements

It's important to acknowledge and celebrate all of your accomplishments, no
matter how tiny. Give yourself a pat on the back when you accomplish a project
milestone, release a new feature, or troubleshoot a difficult bug. A quick
break, telling your team about your accomplishment, or even treating yourself to
something fun can all serve as modest celebrations.  This routine helps you stay
focused for upcoming work, raises morale, and promotes positive behavior.  These
lessons emphasize the importance of consistent habits, breaking projects into
manageable tasks, embracing challenges, focusing on priorities, minimizing
distractions, believing in continuous improvement, leveraging accountability,
celebrating achievements, and committing fully to your goals.
