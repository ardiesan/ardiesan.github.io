The RICCE framework is a handy way to structure prompts when you're working with
Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. It breaks down the prompt into five
key parts: **Role**, **Instructions**, **Context**, **Constraints**, and
**Examples**. By using this approach, you can make sure that the responses you
get are clear, relevant, and effective. Let's break down each part.

#### Role

The **Role** tells the model who or what it's supposed to be. By assigning
a role, you help the model adopt a specific perspective or tone. For example, if
you want the model to give tech advice, you might tell it to act as a "tech
expert." This sets the stage for the kind of language and knowledge it should
use.

#### Instructions

**Instructions** are like direct commands that tell the LLM exactly what to do.
These should be clear and straightforward so the model knows what's expected.
For instance, you could instruct the model to "explain the basics of
photosynthesis" or "summarize this article in one paragraph."

#### Context

**Context** gives the model some background information so it can generate more
accurate and relevant responses. This could be a bit of a backstory or key
details about the topic you're asking about. For example, if you want the model
to write about climate change, you might include some recent facts or events
related to it.

#### Constraints

**Constraints** are the rules or limitations you set for the model. These might
include things like word count, tone, or specific points that should or
shouldnâ€™t be mentioned. For example, you might say "keep the response under 100
words" or "use a casual tone."

#### Examples

**Examples** are sample responses you provide to show the model what you're
looking for. This is super useful when the task is complicated or when you need
a specific style. For instance, if you want the model to write a persuasive
paragraph, you could give it an example of a well-written persuasive argument.

By using the RICCE framework, you can create prompts that are precise, easy to
understand, and tailored to your needs. This will help you get better, more
useful responses from any LLM you work with.
