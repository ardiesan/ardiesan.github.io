## The Pareto Technique

### The 20% that's a bit tricky

When I think about "Working Identity," I realize it’s about more than just
picking a new job. It’s about trying out different roles and sometimes changing
how we see ourselves. This part can be a bit complicated because it involves
deep reflection on who we are and what we truly want in life.

### The 80% that's easier to understand

Imagine I’m playing with different toys to figure out which one I like the most.
Sometimes I play with blocks, other times with cars, and sometimes with dolls.
After playing with each toy for a while, I start to understand which one I enjoy
the most.

In the same way, when adults want to find a new job, they often try out
different kinds of work to see what they like best. Maybe someone who works in
an office tries cooking, teaching, or making things with their hands. By doing
this, they start to learn more about what makes them happy and what kind of job
they want to do for a long time.

So, this book is really about how I—or anyone—can discover what we truly enjoy
doing by experimenting with different things and paying attention to how we feel
about each one. Just like how I learn about my favorite toy by playing with
different ones!
