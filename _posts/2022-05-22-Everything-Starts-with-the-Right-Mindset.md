## Problem, Implementation Problem

Who desires problems? No one! I kid you not. But this is what we are here for. We are engineers,
we are problem solvers.

That is the main basis of what we are going to be paid for. Let's be real, most of us are in this
industry because it pays good, it puts food on the table, it affords us the comforts we desire in
life. Very few among us do this because we are so passionate in software engineering problems.

I get it, you have pride in what you do. We all have. No one is saying do not be proud of you what
can do with software or whatever software development skills you have. You should. I'm merely
saying that we are hired to fill a position whose main job is to solve a problem or potential
problem.

Our job is to do implementation of a design, propose implementation changes as needed, or solve
the implementation problem of a design.

Problem is the common factor between undesirable and desirable attitude.

## Not Desired

### No Solution

Every now and then, we will be put into a situation where we immediately think there is no solution
to the problem that we are working on. A very tempting scenario to pass off the problem solving
aspect of our job to someone else.
