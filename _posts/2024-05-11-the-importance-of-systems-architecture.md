Imagine you’re about to build a house. You have a rough idea of what you want:
a cozy living room, a kitchen that can fit all your gadgets, and enough bedrooms
for everyone in your family. Excited, you hire a team of builders and tell them
to start working. But there's a problem—you haven’t created a blueprint or plan
for the house. The builders start making decisions on their own, but soon they
run into issues. The kitchen ends up too small, the living room has a strange
layout, and worst of all, there’s no room for the bedrooms you wanted.

This is what it’s like to start developing software without a system
architecture or system architecture design.

## What is System Architecture?

System architecture is like the blueprint for a software application. It’s
a detailed plan that describes how your software will work, how the different
parts of the system will connect, and how the software will meet the goals
you’ve set. Just as a blueprint shows where the walls, doors, and windows go in
a house, a system architecture shows how the software components, databases, and
other systems interact.

## Why is System Architecture Important?

### Avoiding Costly Mistakes

Without a clear plan, developers might create a system that doesn’t work well
together or doesn’t meet the needs of your users. Just like in our house
example, fixing these mistakes later can be very expensive and time-consuming.
A good system architecture helps you spot potential issues early, so you can
avoid them before you even start writing code.

### Ensuring Scalability

Imagine your software is successful, and suddenly, thousands of people start
using it. If the system wasn’t designed to handle this, it could crash or slow
down. System architecture helps ensure your software can scale—that is, grow and
handle more users or data without falling apart.

### Making Development Faster

When you have a detailed plan, your software engineers know exactly what they
need to build and how it should work. This makes the development process faster
and smoother because they don’t have to waste time figuring things out as they
go. It’s like giving your builders a detailed blueprint so they can start
constructing the house without confusion.

### Better Communication

System architecture provides a clear vision that everyone involved in the
project can understand. This includes not only the software engineers but also
stakeholders, project managers, and even the marketing team. When everyone is on
the same page, it reduces misunderstandings and ensures that the final product
meets everyone’s expectations.

### Future-Proofing Your Software

Technology changes quickly. A well-thought-out system architecture considers
future needs and potential changes in technology. This way, your software can be
more easily updated or modified as new technologies emerge, saving you from
having to rebuild everything from scratch.

## When to Bring in a Systems Architect

You might think it’s enough to have a rough idea and then hire software
engineers to start building. But without a systems architect to design the
system architecture, you’re taking a big risk. The systems architect is like the
master planner who understands both the technical aspects and the business
goals. They create a detailed map that guides the software engineers in building
the application correctly.

Involving a systems architect early in the project can save time, money, and
a lot of headaches. It’s much easier to adjust plans on paper than to fix
problems in the code later on.

Skipping system architecture is like trying to build a house without
a blueprint. While it might seem quicker or cheaper at first, it usually leads
to more problems and costs down the road. By investing time and effort into
creating a solid system architecture design before you start development, you
set your software project up for success. You’ll avoid costly mistakes, ensure
your software can grow with your needs, and make the development process
smoother for everyone involved.

So, before you dive into coding, take a step back and make sure you have
a strong architectural foundation. Your future self, your users, and your 
software engineers will thank you!
