### 1. Call Out Your Audience

The first step in Sabri Suby’s 17-step formula is to immediately call out your target audience. This tactic is essential because it sets the stage for a highly targeted message that resonates with those most likely to benefit from your offer. By addressing your audience directly, you capture the attention of the people who are already interested or are in need of your product or service. For instance, if your target audience is small business owners, your opening line could be something like, “Attention small business owners struggling with digital marketing!” This direct approach not only grabs attention but also signals that your message is specifically tailored for them.

Understanding who your “dream buyer” is and crafting your message to address their specific challenges, desires, and fears is crucial. This step is about filtering out those who are not a good fit for your offer while attracting those who are. By honing in on the precise needs of your target audience, you set the foundation for a message that deeply resonates and compels action.

### 2. Demand Their Attention With a Big Promise Headline

Once you’ve called out your audience, the next step is to capture their attention with a big promise headline. This headline must be bold, clear, and compelling, directly addressing the primary benefit or outcome your audience desires. It acts as a hook that draws your audience in, making them eager to learn more about what you have to offer. For example, a headline like “Double Your Sales in 90 Days—Guaranteed!” not only grabs attention but also sets a clear expectation that the content will deliver substantial value.

Sabri Suby emphasizes that the headline should not only attract attention but also promise a solution to a pressing problem your audience is facing. The headline should be results-oriented, setting the tone for the rest of your content. This approach ensures that the audience remains engaged and anticipates a valuable payoff for their time spent reading further.

### 3. Create Irresistible Intrigue

After capturing your audience’s attention with a strong headline, the next step is to create irresistible intrigue. This involves sparking curiosity in a way that compels your audience to continue reading. Intrigue can be built through storytelling, asking provocative questions, or hinting at a solution that is yet to be fully revealed. The goal is to make your audience so curious that they feel compelled to keep engaging with your content.

For example, after presenting a powerful headline, you might add something like, “But that’s just the beginning—what I’m about to reveal next will completely change the way you think about marketing.” This type of statement creates an open loop in the reader’s mind, driving them to continue reading to satisfy their curiosity. By making the reader feel that they are about to uncover something valuable and exclusive, you keep them hooked.

### 4. Identify the Problem

Identifying the problem your audience is facing is crucial for establishing a connection and building trust. This step involves clearly articulating the challenges or pain points that your audience is struggling with, demonstrating that you understand their situation. By effectively identifying the problem, you make your audience feel understood, which is a critical first step toward gaining their trust and making them more receptive to your solution.

The problem should be described in a way that resonates deeply with your audience. For instance, you might say, “Are you frustrated with wasting money on ads that don’t convert?” This approach ensures that your audience feels that you are addressing their specific concerns. When you can articulate the problem as well as—or better than—your audience can, they are more likely to trust that you have the solution.

### 5. Provide a Solution

Once you’ve identified the problem, the next step is to provide your solution. This is where you introduce your product or service as the perfect answer to the problem your audience is facing. The key is to position your solution as the most effective, convenient, and possibly exclusive option available. It should feel like a natural and necessary progression from the problem you’ve just outlined.

Sabri Suby emphasizes that your solution should be presented clearly and directly, making it the obvious choice for your audience. For example, if your audience is struggling with low conversion rates, you might offer a software that boosts conversion rates by 50%. By doing this, you make your solution feel like a perfect match for the problem, which helps to move your audience closer to making a purchase.

### 6. Show Credentials

Establishing credibility is essential when presenting your solution. This step involves showcasing your credentials, such as experience, expertise, or success stories, to prove that you are qualified to solve the problem you’ve identified. This might include testimonials, case studies, awards, or even your personal track record in the industry.

By highlighting your credentials, you build trust and reassure your audience that they are in capable hands. This step is about proving that you have the experience and success necessary to back up your claims. Whether it’s industry recognition, client success stories, or your own professional background, your credentials help differentiate you from competitors and make your solution more convincing.

### 7. Detail the Benefits

Detailing the benefits of your solution goes beyond listing features—it’s about showing how those features translate into positive outcomes for the customer. This step involves clearly articulating the value your product or service will bring to your audience, focusing on the benefits that directly address their needs and desires.

For example, instead of simply saying, “Our software has advanced analytics,” you might say, “Our advanced analytics will help you identify new opportunities to increase your revenue.” This approach ensures that your audience understands not just what your product does, but how it will improve their lives or businesses. By focusing on the customer’s perspective, you make it easier for them to see the value in your offer and feel confident in their decision to purchase.

### 8. Social Proof

Social proof is one of the most persuasive tools in your marketing arsenal. This step involves using testimonials, reviews, or case studies to show that others have successfully used your product or service. Social proof leverages the psychological tendency to follow the actions of others, especially when those others are similar to us or are seen as authorities.

Suby emphasizes that social proof should be specific and genuine. For instance, a testimonial that says, “Using this program, we increased our sales by 70% in just two months,” is far more convincing than a vague statement like “This program is great.” Social proof can be the tipping point for conversions—when potential customers see that others like them have succeeded, they are more likely to trust your offer and make a purchase.

### 9. Make Your Godfather Offer

The "Godfather Offer" is a key component of Suby’s strategy. It’s an offer so compelling that your audience can’t refuse it. This offer typically includes your main product or service bundled with additional bonuses, guarantees, and other incentives that create overwhelming value for the customer. The goal is to remove any hesitation or perceived risk, making it easy for your audience to say yes.

Suby advises that your Godfather Offer should eliminate any potential objections by providing an irresistible combination of value. This might involve offering a money-back guarantee, adding exclusive bonuses, or providing a limited-time discount. The idea is to make the offer so good that the customer feels they would be missing out if they didn’t take advantage of it.

### 10. Add Bonuses

Adding bonuses is a powerful way to increase the perceived value of your offer. These bonuses should complement your main product or service and should be framed as exclusive, limited-time additions that enhance the overall value of the offer. By offering something extra, you can push hesitant customers over the edge and encourage them to make a purchase.

Suby suggests that bonuses should be highly relevant and desirable to your target audience. For example, if you’re selling an online course, offering a free ebook or additional training materials as bonuses can make the overall package much more appealing. The psychological impact of bonuses is significant—customers feel like they are getting more than they’re paying for, which can be a strong motivator for completing the purchase.

### 11. Stack the Value

Stacking the value is a psychological strategy designed to make the offer appear far more valuable than the price you’re asking. This technique involves breaking down every component of your offer, assigning a value to each item, and then presenting the total value as significantly higher than the price tag. By listing the individual elements such as the main product, bonuses, and any extra features, you emphasize just how much the customer is getting. For example, if you're selling a product along with additional training materials, cheat sheets, and bonus services, show the price of each item before revealing the combined package price.

The power of this approach lies in demonstrating that the customer is receiving an overwhelming amount of value for what they’re paying. Sabri Suby’s strategy is rooted in making the customer feel like they are getting a massive deal—a bundle that they can’t possibly refuse. When done effectively, this method creates a sense of excitement and urgency, as buyers perceive the offer as too good to pass up.

### 12. Reveal Your Price

After showcasing the immense value of your offer, you reveal the price. By this stage, the customer should already feel that the offer is worth far more than what they are being asked to pay. This is where price anchoring comes into play. Sabri Suby recommends initially suggesting a higher price to establish a perceived value, only to then reveal a lower, more attractive price. This tactic creates a strong sense of getting a great deal, which can push customers towards making a purchase.

The key is to present the price as a minor detail compared to the tremendous value they will receive. It’s important to ensure that your price seems like a bargain, which helps reduce friction in the decision-making process. This step requires confidence in the value you’ve built up in previous steps so that when the price is finally revealed, the customer feels relief, not shock.

### 13. Inject Scarcity

Scarcity is one of the most powerful psychological triggers that marketers can use to drive urgency. This step involves creating a sense of limited availability, whether it’s time-sensitive discounts, a limited number of products, or even exclusive access. By making it clear that the offer won’t last forever, you encourage customers to act quickly, tapping into their fear of missing out (FOMO).

Sabri Suby stresses that scarcity should be genuine—artificial scarcity can lead to customer distrust. For example, you might offer a special deal for the first 100 buyers or state that the discount expires at midnight. This tactic leverages human psychology’s tendency to value something more when it’s in short supply or when there’s a looming deadline.

### 14. Give a Powerful Guarantee

Offering a strong guarantee is crucial in reducing the risk perceived by the customer, which can remove one of the biggest barriers to making a purchase. By offering guarantees, such as money-back options or satisfaction guarantees, you assure your potential buyers that they have nothing to lose by trying your product. A well-crafted guarantee can shift the risk from the buyer to the seller, making the decision to purchase easier.

Sabri Suby recommends going beyond basic guarantees to offer something bold, which reinforces confidence in your product. A guarantee like “Double your money back if you’re not satisfied!” not only eliminates customer hesitation but also adds credibility to your offer. This step often closes the sale for those still on the fence, providing them with peace of mind that their investment is protected.

### 15. Call to Action

The call to action (CTA) is one of the most critical elements of your landing page. It’s the point where you direct your audience to take the next step, whether that’s buying your product, signing up for a service, or scheduling a consultation. Suby advises that your CTA should be clear, concise, and compelling. Avoid vague language—be direct in telling your audience what to do next, such as “Click here to order now!” or “Sign up today!”

The CTA should also emphasize the benefits of taking action, reminding the customer of the incredible value they will receive. It’s also helpful to reiterate any scarcity elements or guarantees that can make the decision even easier. Strong, action-oriented CTAs ensure that potential customers don’t miss the opportunity to convert after all the value-building work you’ve done.

### 16. The Warning

Including a warning in your offer can serve as a final nudge for those who are still hesitant. This step is where you remind your audience of the consequences of inaction. For example, you might warn them that if they don’t act now, they could miss out on a special deal or remain stuck with the problem they are currently facing. This tactic plays into the psychology of loss aversion—people are often more motivated by the fear of losing something than by the prospect of gaining something.

The warning should be framed in a way that highlights the urgency of taking action now. For instance, “Don’t let this opportunity slip away—you could be missing out on transforming your business!” This element reinforces the scarcity and urgency you’ve built up throughout your offer, making it even harder for your audience to procrastinate or walk away.

### 17. Close With a Reminder

In your closing, it’s essential to remind your audience of the benefits of your offer and why they should take action immediately. This step serves as a final recap of all the value you’ve built, emphasizing the unique selling points, the bonuses, and the scarcity of the offer. It’s also a good place to reiterate the guarantee to reassure customers who may still be on the fence.

A strong close ties everything together and leaves your audience with no doubts about the decision they need to make. By summarizing the key points—like the incredible value they’re getting, the limited availability, and the risk-free nature of the offer—you reinforce the urgency and make it clear that now is the time to act.
